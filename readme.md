## Description

We have built multiple recommendation engines based on Graph Theory, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. The implementation for each class of the recommendation system is present in its own directory as evident by the directory name.

To set up each form/class of recommendation system, proceed to its corresponding directory and follow the steps mentioned in directory specific readme files.

All of these implementations were built for the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
